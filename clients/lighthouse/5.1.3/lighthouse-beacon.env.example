# Once the validator monitor reaches this number of local validators it will stop collecting per-validator Prometheus metrics and issuing per-validator logs. Instead, it will provide aggregate metrics and logs. This avoids infeasibly high cardinality in the Prometheus database and high log volume when using many validators. Defaults to 64.

# Specify a weak subjectivity checkpoint in `block_root:epoch` format to verify the node's sync against. The block root should be 0x-prefixed. Note that this flag is for verification only, to perform a checkpoint sync from a recent state use --checkpoint-sync-url.
