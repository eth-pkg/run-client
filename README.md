# run-client
Ethereum client scripts to run clients, but with standardized options

NOTE: This repository is in active development. Code can change drasticially,
and except bugs. 

## Running a node 

Open two terminals and execute the following commands:

Terminal 1:
```bash 
bash run-client.sh --network <network> \
                   --consensus-client <consensus_client> \
                   --execution-client <execution_client> \
                   --run execution 
```

Terminal 2:
```bash
bash run-client.sh --network <network> \
                   --consensus-client <consensus_client> \
                   --execution-client <execution_client> \
                   --run consensus 
```

## Running with simplified approach

This will run a node with selected network and clients. Note this is intended as examples. 

```
bash run-node.sh --network <network> \
                   --consensus-client <consensus_client> \
                   --execution-client <execution_client>
```
